<h1>Hey, that the Valentine app ♥</h1>

<h2>🤔 What is it?</h2>

<p>Valentine is the project, where man can create a unique Valentine page for your fiáncee. You can choose the page's design, make a text by yourself. Also, you can leave your name at this postcard or choose not to leave it. <br> <br>
The project is created by 2 people to 14 Feb 2023 and it uses Telegram bot as the way of building a page and Vue.js with Tailwind CSS to show the postcard.</p>

<h2>⚙ How does it work?</h2>

<p>Your link shares data with the website with string query. This query is made by Telegram bot using the data you send. When the link opens, website takes the data and creates a page.</p>

<h2>🙋‍♂️ How can I create a page?</h2>

<p>For now there is no way to create the page :( This project is now freezed and it will be reworked as Valentine 2.0. <br> You can check all the new features, updates and releases on <a href="https://github.com/Serpant1ne/Valentine-2.0">this page<a/>. <p/>
